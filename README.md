# voxel-viewer-page
A template for voxel-viewer, just to replace vox link with yours!
## How to use
We need to replace the voxel link in the handler.js file. We can open the handler.js file in your IDE, and in the 19th line, we need to replace the link in src tag to the permanent link of the voxel file.
